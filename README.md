# Acknowledgements
A big thanks to individuals and organizations who have shared their data, code, and ideas openly and timely. 
This repo draws from https://github.com/beoutbreakprepared/nCoV2019 and https://github.com/jameshay218/case_to_infection
who have kindly shared their R code to download, clean and summarize the data. 

These repos also have extensive analysis drawing from additional data sources (kudo, GIS) which I have excluded here.

Where possible, I tried to re-use their R code but also re-implemented them in Python to suit my needs
